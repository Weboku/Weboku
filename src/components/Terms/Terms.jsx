        <p>
          While we apply best practices and data-backed strategies, we do not guarantee specific results such as keyword rankings, traffic, or revenue. Client-side platform performance and external factors may influence outcomes.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Termination Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Engagements may be terminated by either party with written notice. Fees for completed work and active deliverables must be settled. We reserve the right to discontinue service due to misuse, breach, or non-payment.
